> Building the Open Game System (OGS) - bridging web and native gaming experiences

The Open Game Collective builds tools that empower developers to create cross-platform gaming experiences. Our Open Game System (OGS) bridges the gap between web and native capabilities, enabling developers to build once and reach players everywhere with features like push notifications üì± and TV casting üì∫ that typically require native app development.

## What is the Open Game System?

The Open Game System (OGS) is an ecosystem that enables web games to access native features while maintaining their web-first nature. OGS provides:

- **Cross-Platform Reach** üåç: Deploy once, play everywhere
- **Native Capabilities** üîî: Push notifications, TV casting, and more
- **Developer-First** üíª: Simple SDKs with clear, consistent patterns
- **Independent Integration** üß©: Use only the components you need

## Components

### SDKs üß∞

Our SDKs follow a headless pattern that separates state from UI, giving developers complete control over presentation while handling complex system interactions:

- **[auth-kit](https://github.com/open-game-collective/auth-kit)**: Account linking between your game and OGS
- **[notification-kit](https://github.com/open-game-collective/notification-kit)**: Push notifications for web games
- **[cast-kit](https://github.com/open-game-collective/cast-kit)**: TV casting capabilities for web games

### Platform Components üì±üåê

- **[opengame-app](https://github.com/open-game-collective/opengame-app)**: Mobile companion app (iOS/Android) that enables native features
- **[opengame-org](https://github.com/open-game-collective/opengame-org)**: Web platform for discovering and playing OGS-compatible games

### Reference Implementation ‚≠ê

- **[trivia-jam](https://github.com/open-game-collective/trivia-jam)**: Interactive trivia platform demonstrating OGS integration

## Specification

The [OGS Specification](https://github.com/open-game-collective/specification) defines the protocols and requirements for integrating with the Open Game System. The specification covers:

- Account Linking Protocol
- Push Notification Protocol
- TV Casting Protocol

For detailed technical requirements, refer to the [specification repository](https://github.com/open-game-collective/specification).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with OGS is to:

1. Choose which features you need (authentication, notifications, casting)
2. Install the relevant SDK packages
3. Follow the implementation guides in the SDK documentation
4. Test your integration with the OGS development environment
5. Complete the certification process for production access
